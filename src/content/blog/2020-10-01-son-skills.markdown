#### This skill is the difference between stalling out or climbing up in every area of life.

### Is the Goal the Destination or the Journey?

Recently, my toddler began riding a balance bike (a bike with two wheels and no pedals or training wheels). Watching his progress from hesitantly walking alongside the bike to riding faster than he can run has been inspirational. Through the falls, tears, and endless attempts, he always gets back up, never needing prompting to practice, and never giving up.

This got me thinking: How does he do it? How does he wake up every morning and go after new skills with a smile on his face? How can he fail time and time again, but continue to move forward? What keeps him from getting discouraged and giving up?

After mastering crawling, I watched as he tried to walk. These attempts at walking were much slower and more difficult than if he just crawled to his favorite toy, but that didn't matter. The failure of not quite making it drives him. The pain of failing makes the taste of success so much sweeter. The pride on his face when he finally took those first steps or lifted his feet while riding the balance bike could never be achieved without falling.

I can vividly remember the difficulty of learning to ride a bike, the excitement of growth. I recognized that despite all of my interest in growing in my career, self-improvement, and various side hustles, I had become complacent and stagnant. I still tended to reject new things, clinging to my old ways.

How could I regain my childlike excitement to learn?

### Failure as a Skill

My ability to fail was critical to the greatest period of learning in my life. The human brain doubles in size in the first year of life and reaches 90% of adult size by age 5 [1]. Without failure, I wouldn't have learned to crawl, walk, run, read, write, or add fractions. I never would have been able to form relationships or tell jokes. All of these skills began as uncontested failures but ended in mastery (well, maybe not telling jokes). The only thing I needed to learn those skills was the skill of failing, learning, and picking myself back up.

I've been watching my kids play every day. They fall, fail, get frustrated, and struggle to do basic tasks like pull up their pants and put on their shoes. Why do they keep going? **They aren't afraid to fail — they accept failure as part of the process.**

Thankfully, failure is an easy skill to learn, albeit painful. I only needed to go slightly outside of my comfort zone.

I've always wanted to improve my interpersonal skills. I struggle with the finer points of Emotional Intelligence. So I started small — I struck up a conversation with a co-worker whom I only ever said hello to. It was pleasant, but not great, and we didn't end up becoming friends. It was painful to realize that it didn't work out the way I'd hoped. However, **I learned more from the failure than I would have from success.** Starting small is still starting.

Once I broke the initial fear barrier, I was well on my way to success. I began to realize that failing is not that scary. I can learn this new skill, and fail, and everything will be just fine. Putting myself out there was the only way to get the results I wanted.

> "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."  
> ― **Winston S. Churchill**

When I start feeling more ambitious, I might try something a little farther outside of my comfort zone: intentionally getting embarrassed. Tim Ferriss, the author of _The 4-Hour Workweek,_ suggests going outside your comfort zone by lying on the floor in the middle of a long line at Starbucks. Here are some pandemic-friendly ideas:

-   Tell a stranger an embarrassing story.
-   Insist on ordering a strange meal at a restaurant.
-   Ask a stranger to explain why everyone is wearing masks.

I am told I will begin to find that the only person who cares about my embarrassment is me. When I can let go of that fear, I will connect with the energy of my childhood.

> **Just like my boy, I will try new things with unbridled curiosity, unencumbered by my desire to appear competent.**

### The Expert Beginner

The expert beginner is someone who has mastered the skill of failure. By seeking out failure everywhere I go, I acknowledge my insufficiency and prime my mind to learn and grow. Each day becomes more fulfilling and exciting, a new journey through an old forest.

Becoming an expert beginner is all about humility. At first, I thought this meant that I would need to internalize thoughts of incompetence, making me more 'humble'.

> Humility isn't about feeling lesser, it is an expression of a deep sense of self worth.

I found that I needed to cultivate my self-worth from outside of the things that I do. My self worth needed to come from an internal, abiding sense of dignity and love. Once I fully understood that my self worth is not contained in the things I do, but instead who I am, I was able to grow in the virtue of humility.

Instead of approaching each problem with a solution, I try listening or asking a question. In place of doing what has always been done, I briefly consider why. This change in mindset enables me to accept both my imperfections and the imperfections of those around me. I did not need to "prove myself" anymore.

As I work towards becoming an expert beginner, I have found it easier to:

-   Be creative and consider new ideas and viewpoints.
-   Build relationships with others.
-   Accept constructive criticism.
-   Enjoy the process of failure and growth, rather than resenting and avoiding it.

### Conclusion

Just like children, the skill of failure is critical to growing as humans. Letting go of the fear of failure, embarrassment, and disappointment allows me to learn

Give yourself permission to learn and grow by letting go of your fears. With a little practice and a lot of patience, you can grow into the person you truly want to be, one day at a time.
